BarcodeDemo
===========

A PhoneGap app demoing the [BarcodeScanner Plugin](http://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner).

Includes config.xml file for [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com).

Used a sample as a jump start to get this done faster, but added a little customization.

Changed scanner page from demo to save info to a DIV instead of an alert.
